                                I can always tell if Ny has entered the building by the noises her jewelry makes. As she leads me into the dorm room, I hear her charms, bracelets, and rings clink against each other lightly. <br>

                                <br> “I feel so naked now without them on,” Ny jokes, “I feel like my standard for jewelry is if I can take a shower in it without taking them off.” <br>
                                
                                <br> As I snap a quick overview of her collection, I notice her avid love for gold (a stark contrast to a die-hard silver girl like myself). <br>
                                
                                <br>“I got these from when I went back home, or to Vietnam, or at the Viet gold shops around here,” Ny remarks, “I think gold just suits me better.”

                                After analyzing the trend in Ny’s collection, I finally ask her what the most<br> significant piece in her jewelry is. <br>

                                <br>After a second of consideration, she slowly slides off the jade ring on her<br> index finger, which stands out the most due to the jade bracelet styled on<br> the same arm. <br>
                                
                                <br>“This used to be my parents’ engagement ring,” Ny explains, “They couldn’t <br>afford to get a brand new engagement ring when they first got married, so <br>they took this jade ring that used to be my [maternal] grandmother’s.”  <br>
                                
                                <br>“So it’s quite a generational item, almost like a family heirloom?” I ask. <br>
                                
                                <br>Ny thoughtfully replies,“I guess so. It not only means a lot to myself, but<br> to so many others. This ring carries a different weight.”

                                      <h4 id="subhead-two-b">“I hope it doesn’t break — like ever”</h4>

                                    I quickly notice a jade pendant made of both white and normal jade <br>stone, laced around an elegant layer of flat gold chain. As she notices <br>my eyes observing the necklace, she quickly explains her influence in <br> jewelry taste from close family: “I decided to buy more jade accessories<br> because it’s supposed to protect you from bad luck.” <br>

                                    <br> “My mom influenced a lot of my taste in jewelry, and I think her jade ring <br>inspired me to get other jade pieces in my collection,” Ny elaborates, “I hope <br>it doesn’t break – like ever!” <br>

                                    <br> Clearly Ny’s jewelery box has tight ties to her family, particularly her mother, as<br> Ny states, “I just think it’s nice to carry things reminiscent of my mom with me.” <br>

                                    <br>And it’s clear the feelings are reciprocated. Even though Ny is a native New <br>Yorker from Long Island (the half of which is New York!) and lives pretty close to home, her mother bought her the jade pendant and bracelet to protect her daughter from evil spirits and negative energy.

                                        In the interest of time, I quickly move on to the series of bracelets she has stacked on both arms. <br>

                                        <br>“I think my current most favorite one is this bracelet I got in Vietnam,” Ny exclaims, “I just had to get it, there were so many cute charms! But I got it because it has a rat (far left) charm, and I thought it would bring me good luck for the upcoming lunar new year, ‘cuz it was the year of the rat.” <br>
                                        
                                        <br>Sometimes, you just pick up things for the heck of it. And you fall in love with your choice of brief spontaneity more than you fell in love with the surprise, or in Ny’s case, coincidence. </p>

                                        After Ny confirms the trend in her jewelry I noticed, I can’t help but notice a classic bead-and-string bracelet tied around her wrist.<br>

                                        <br>“And what about that one?” I ask, “it seems quite personal.”<br>
                                        
                                        “I got this one recently when Harper and I went to my house together! Remember earlier this semester?” Ny asks.<br>
                                        
                                        <br>Of course I do. They were so ecstatic about spending a weekend with Ny’s family, hanging out in the quiet suburbs before returning back to the chaotic streets of lower Manhattan. <br>
                                        
                                        <br>As Ny carries on, she states, “We just spontaneously got it. I think us being roommates and friends means a lot to begin with, but just having something ordinary like a friendship bracelet means a lot, you know?”
