                          Harper has a very minimalist sense in terms of jewelry – the total opposite of her sense in shoes and scarves, any other accessory, basically. <br>

                          <br>“What’s the one word you would use to describe your collection in jewelry? “ I ask. 

                          There’s not even a moment of pause. Harper is a girl who knows what she wants. “I’d say love, friendship, and loyalty. Loyalty is everything [to me].”

                          “This is my mom’s grad ring, from when she was in college in <br> the 90s”, Harper explained. <br>

                          <br>“I actually can’t remember if I ‘stole it’ from her or not,” she <br> chuckles, “but basically, I think that the point of me owning this <br> ring is that this is something quite personal to my mom,” she explains. <br>
                          
                          <br>After close observation, I point out, “Look, you can even see her name!”  <br>
                          
                          Her mom’s custom ring has engraved her name, and the two college <br>sports she used to play during her university years in Germany.

                                  <br> “This is a David Yurman bracelet my dad got for me – this is the first <br> piece of jewelry my dad ever got for me, which is why it’s so special!” <br>Harper explains. <br>

                                  <br> Knowing Harper’s clear love for David Yurman, its obvious why that’s <br> her signature bracelet. It’s “the” go-to. <br>
                                  
                                  <br>She continues, “And this is my birth stone, which is blue topaz!” <br>
                                  
                                  <br> It seems that carrying both jewelry from her parents portrays a theme <br>of security and good luck for Harper.</p>

                                  “My grandma got this ring for me from a fair,” Harper explains. <br>

                                  <br> There really is no standard in Harper’s jewelry when it comes to someone<br> she loves – in particular, her family. <br>
                                  
                                 <br> Sometimes it also doesn’t matter what the jewelry is made of – it is more<br> like, what the jewelry represents, and what it holds. </p>

                                  Towards the end of her succinct collection, I ask Harper, “So, if <br>you had to choose an ultimate theme across your favorite [jewelry]<br> pieces, how would you describe it?” <br>

                                  <br> Without even a pause, Harper states, “I would probably say the love <br> I feel or have in my life.” <br>
                                  
                                 <br> “All in all, I feel that the most important feature I look for in anything <br> – love, friends, and family – is loyalty.”
