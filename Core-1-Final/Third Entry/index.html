                        “I also like to thrift for jewelry so I can style them easier,” Kayla tells me as she rearranges her most prized items. 

                        "I think there’s a certain fun collecting items that, you know, you can style however you like – you can build sentimental memories off of that too,” she remarks.

                        “I wanted to make something personal, so I went ahead and  <br>bought these charms and stones from the local hobby-lobby,” <br>Kayla explains, “and I had this leftover lace from this project <br>so I figured I should reuse it as a choker!” <br>

                        <br>Kayla is definitely a prime example of the ideal Parsons <br> Fashion Design student: resourceful, witty, and a handful <br> of personal style – even in the smaller details in life.

                        <p>Within 10 minutes of our interview, I quickly notice that <br> Kayla is a huge fan of chunky pieces. <br>

                           <br> “This one really stood out to me while I was thrifting,” she explains, “this one originally had a magnetic clasp, which <br>was nice to know because I knew I wouldn’t loose it.” <br>
                            
                          <br>  “Ironically, it broke off though,” Kayla laments, “so I <br> don’t wear it as a necklace anymore.” <br>
                            
                           <br> Although the necklace doesn’t serve its original purpose anymore, “it’s a great bag charm, because I can just tie this around wherever I want it to be, no one suspects it used to <br> be a necklace.” <br>
                            
                           <br> It seems Kayla truly styles everything upon her touch.</p>

                               <br>  “I remember my sister and I made a beeline for this<br> necklace because it’s so dainty, and it’s really refined.” <br>

                               <br> “She bought this for me as a surprise from thrifting <br> at a vintage store.” <br>

                               <br> I agree, surprised, “Yeah, I thought you bought this for yourself!” <br>
